        <p id="credit"> For the American Press &mdash; February 13, 2017</p>

        <!--story-->
        <p>If you’re in Lake Charles during Mardi Gras season, you’re within 3.46 miles of a king cake.</p>

        <p>The American Press contacted nearly 100 bakeries, stores and cafes and found 35 that sell the seasonal treat. Their locations dot the city, ensuring you’d never have to travel more than a few miles to satisfy your sweet tooth.</p>

        <p>Your longest trek — those 3.46 miles — is from the corner of Highway 397 and Swift Plant Road to Highway 14’s Donut King.</p>

        <p>Many king cake shops are steeped in tradition: Pronia’s Deli and Bakery and Misse’s Grocery in Sulphur have built king cake followings since the 1990s.</p>

        <p>Others are much newer.</p>

        <p>This year marks the second Mardi Gras season for Jake Stutes’ Charleston Bistro on Ryan Street in downtown Lake Charles.</p>

        <p>He moved his baking operation there from Jake’s Deli and Bakery in Sulphur, which he sold two weeks ago.</p>

        <p>He first started baking, though, in his grandmother’s Sulphur donut shop, and his king cakes — at Jake’s, at the Charleston — all use her original recipe.</p>

        <p>“While I’m making the cakes, I’m just thinking about all of my memories of growing up baking,” Stutes said.</p>

        <p>At the Charleston, he makes 30 to 40 each day and offers 14 varieties.</p>

        <p>His most popular cake is a more recent addition, a chocolate-dipped strawberry king cake with the customer’s choice of filling.</p>

        <p>The Bekery’s Rebekah Hoffpauir grew up baking, too: through high school and college, she measured, mixed, baked and sold treats out of her home kitchen.</p>

        <p>She started experimenting with various king cake recipes two years ago and sold her final concoction — a combination of several recipes — over Facebook during the 2016 Mardi Gras season.</p>

        <p>Now, those cakes are a centerpiece of her own shop, The Bekery, which opened Oct. 21 on W. 11th Street.</p>

        <p>She and her team crank out 20 full-size and 20 miniature cakes each day in multiple flavors, including cinnamon, pecan praline, chocolate, lemon icebox and cream cheese. She said her bakery’s small size allows her to cater to special requests, too.</p>

        <p>“I always just wanted to feed people and make them happy,” Hoffpauir said. “I love seeing people enjoying my baked goods.”</p>

        <p>Arguably the newest addition to the king cake landscape, though, is Great Harvest Bread Co., which sold its first cake on Jan. 26.</p>

        <p>Operated by husband-and-wife team Michael and Shelly Migues, the Lake Street bakery and cafe has sold its from-scratch breads, sandwiches and baked goods as part of the national Great Harvest chain since its Nov. 11 debut.</p>

        <p>Great Harvest locations, though, are “freedom franchises,” so owners can customize their cafes’ interiors and menus.</p>

        <p>For the Migues family, that meant adding king cake.</p>

        <p>They adopted a Great Harvest-developed recipe, which is also in use at the Lafayette location, and sell three flavors: cinnamon twist, chocolate twist and turtle.</p>

        <p>Bakers pull up at 4 a.m. to start their sifting and stirring and so far, customers have been receptive, Michael said.</p>

        <p>With such a rich king cake tradition, Lake Charles has embraced its baking newcomers.</p>

        <p>Anything to make that trip to the nearest king cake shorter.</p>
