        <h3><b>Cover Letter</b></h3> </div>


<div class="job-text">To whom it might concern </div>
<p></p>
  <div class="job-text">Spring 2019. It was a sunny Sunday afternoon and I was about to step into a sketchy alley in West-Baltimore to find a little boy who had shot himself on a foot there four years earlier.
    Did his parents know that while they were in the middle of family tragedy, a code running from Russia used their boy to launch a massive misinformation campaign against Baltimore?
    They probably didn’t. Hardly anyone did.</div>

<div class="job-text">We never found the boy; his family had moved away, and I finished my article without them. Yet, it became one of my favorite reporting experiences for a while. Although the story included everything, I love about data journalism: tens of gigabytes of messy data, a lot of R code, endless digging and a lot of eye drops; it also had faces, people and stories. Few scripts of code can take us to alleys, we’ve never thought of going before. This is why data skills, together with traditional reporting techniques are powerful sources in both investigative and daily reporting.</div>

<div class="job-text">When the <a style="color:navy" href "https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/08/28/maryland-was-never-play-russians-targeted-it-anyway/"> story finally ran in the Washington Post </a>, I was already finishing my summer internship at the Associated Press data team. I worked on my own data-driven stories, analyzed data for several enterprise stories and provided reporters with new ideas driven from and illustrated by data.</div>

<div class="job-text">My stories in AP have shown <a style="color:navy" href "https://apnews.com/4b75785affde443aa50bae8e5331542f"> the scope of the opioid epidemic</a>
  ; <a style="color:navy" href "https://apnews.com/75df5e7bf56e43df99d091bc4d16a87d"> misuse of tariff subsidies</a> and <a style="color:navy" href "https://apnews.com/e6ef3a8ca1454c7595108b1284ad7bd9"> staff shortages in federal jails</a>.</div>

<div class="job-text">During my graduate studies I was part of several investigative projects examining
  <a style="color:navy" href "https://apnews.com/7b813430797b2c0361fa86d34c8cb71d/"> jail suicides among mentally ill patients across the U.S</a>;
    <a style="color:navy" href "https://cnsmaryland.org/interactives/fall-2019/behind-bars/"> sentencing and resentencing juvenile lifers</a>; and climate change.
</div>
<div class="job-text">Although my passion is to use data skills in investigative reporting, I’m also quick to use data for daily or breaking news. During my years working as a staff reporter for both of Estonia’s national daily papers, I became well-adjusted to the flow and speed to daily news cycle and I have good instincts for finding stories that are not only newsworthy but also matter. My Estonian investigative stories have helped to change education laws and to draw attention to minority problems. I’ve shown inhumane working conditions in Cambodian garment factories,  reported on oil damage in South Nigeria and worked 17h days in Paris to cover 13 November terrorist attacks.</div>

<div class="job-text">By summer 2020, I will hold a master’s degree from University of Maryland with a special focus on how to use computational journalism in investigative reporting. My data skills include RStudio, Python, CSS, HTML, QGIS web scraping and others.
</div>
<div class="job-text">I believe that my reporting experience both in the U.S. and Europe, together with my computational journalism skills, will make me an excellent candidate for this position.
</div>
<div class="job-text">I’d be happy to answer any questions you might have and see more of my work from my <a style="color:navy" href "https://riinaljas.github.io/riinaljas/"> online portfolio </a></div>

<div class="job-text">Sincerely, Riin Aljas
